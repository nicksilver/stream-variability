* Introduction
We are exploring the effects of aridity on the distribution of streamflow using
the Budyko frame work.

- Outline the Budyko framework

- Discuss what the w parameter represents (hydrologic efficiency)

- When we see trends in interannual variability of hydrologic variables we often
  assume they are driven by changes in precipitation. This study shows that
  these changes in variability can be altered solely by changes in temperature
  and landcover, highlighting the importance of studying all aspects of
  climatic and terrestial processes when evaluating existing trends and
  predicting future changes.


* Methods
- More detailed explanation of Budyko framework.

* Results

** Scenario 1: Changes in aridity
We look at how changes in aridity (i.e. ${pet}_{p}$) impact the long-term
distribution of streamflow.

When holding landcover constant (i.e. water availability), but changing climatic
conditions (i.e. precipitation and potential evapotranspiration) the resulting
distribution of year-to-year average streamflow dramatically changes (fig.
fig:aridity). Lower aridity environments allow for broader, more variable
streamflow, while higher aridity environments constrain the variability of
average annual streamflow.


** Scenario 2: Changes in hydrologic efficiecy in wet environments
Here, we hold aridity constant at a energy-limited condition (PET/P = 0.5) and
we change water availability using the w parameter (w = 1.6, 2.6, and 3.6).

In wet environments, when increasing the hydrologic efficiency of the landscape
(i.e. the ability of the landscape to use water) interannual variability of
streamflow increases. In addition, there are shifts in mean streamflow that come
from greater amounts of water being partitioned into evapotranspiration.

** Scenario 3: Changes in hydrologic efficiency in dry environments
In this scenario we hold aridity constant at a water-limited condition (PET/P =
2.0) and we change the water availability using the w parameter (w = 1.6, 2.6,
and 3.6).

We explore the effects of water supply through changes in hydrologic efficiency
(i.e. w) on streamflow interannual availability, represented by the standard
deviation of the distribution, across all environments (wet to dry; fig XX).
The relationship between these variables is complex. Changes in hydrologic
efficiency across the landscape impact streamflow differently in different
environments. In wet environments increasing efficiency increases variability,
while in dry environments increasing efficiency decreases variability. There is
a transition between these two states at around PET/P = 1.5. In these,
transitional environments, streamflow variability is largely insensitive to
changes in hydrologic efficiency. Overall, stream variability is most sensitive to
landscape changes in wetter environments (0 < PET/P <= 1.5).

*** TODO What is the amount of landcover where 0 < PET/P <= 1.5?

* Discussion

** Scenario 1: Changes in aridity
The difference in interannual variability of streamflow between different
aridity conditions is driven by the water (or supply; AET_P == 1) limit which
constrains the amount of water available for runoff year-to-year, therefore
reducing the amount of interannual variablity.

This brings to light an interesting phenomenom that has yet to be explicitly
highlighted in the literature: if there is a monotonic change in aridity over
time (i.e. global warming) interannual variability of streamflow will tend to
decrease regardless of changes in the overall supply of water. It is, therefore,
possible to see changes in streamflow variability directly from changes in
temperature even if precipitation stays the same. Conversely, if precipitation
were to increase and temperature were held constant (or increased less) then
aridity would overall decrease and interannual variability of streamflow would
increase.
